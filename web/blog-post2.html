        <h2>How I Built My Own Coding Platform</h2>
        <p>Freelancing is one of the best ways for students to earn money, gain experience, and build a strong
            portfolio—all while studying. Whether you’re a designer, developer, writer, or video editor, freelancing
            gives you the flexibility to work on real-world projects at your own pace.</p>

        <p>Start by choosing a skill you enjoy and are good at. Platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and Freelancer.com are
            great places to create a profile and showcase your services. Make sure your bio is clear and your gig
            descriptions are professional and to the point.</p>

        <p>Time management is key. Balance your classes and work by setting clear deadlines and using tools like Trello
            or Notion to stay organized. Never overpromise—quality matters more than quantity.</p>


        <p>Also, build your personal brand. Create a simple portfolio website to showcase your work, add client reviews,
            and maybe even share a few blog posts like this one!</p>

        <p>Lastly, don’t fear rejection. Every failed proposal is a step closer to success. Keep learning, keep updating
            your skills, and stay consistent. With patience and persistence, freelancing can become a game-changer for
            your career—even before you graduate.</p>
