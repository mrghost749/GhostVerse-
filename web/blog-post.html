    <h2>How I Built My Own Coding Platform</h2>
    <p>Creating a coding platform was one of the biggest challenges I faced in my journey as a developer. It started with a simple idea: to build a place where coders could share, practice, and learn new skills.</p>

    <p>Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built the frontend with a clean UI. For the backend, I used Firebase for authentication and real-time database. I also integrated a code editor using CodeMirror and added challenge modules.</p>

    <p>This platform not only helped me learn full-stack development but also inspired many others to join the community.</p>
