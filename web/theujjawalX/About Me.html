    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><h1>Hey! I’m <strong>Ujjawal Sharma</strong>,Hello!  a passionate and creative individual with a strong interest in technology, design, and content creation. I enjoy exploring new ways to express ideas, whether it’s through coding, visual design, or engaging videos. As a student and freelancer, I’ve developed a solid foundation in web development, especially using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m currently working on exciting mini projects like “QuickcodePro,” a platform focused on code and freelancing, with a sleek black and blue theme.

      Alongside web development, I run a gaming YouTube channel called The Ujjawal Gaming, where I share gameplay, tips, and fun shorts that connect with viewers. I'm also active on Fiverr as a freelancer, offering services like YouTube content creation, poster designs, and visiting card layouts.
      
      One of my biggest goals is to create innovative tech experiences, like an AI-Powered Virtual Assistant inspired by Jarvis. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy pushing the limits of creativity and logic.
      
      Outside of the digital world, I love anime, gaming, and connecting with like-minded individuals. I’m always open to collaboration, new challenges, and opportunities to grow.
      
      Let’s create something amazing together!.</p></h1>
